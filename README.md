Final Project for Structure of Programming
Nazeer Ahmad Dec 2023

For the Final Project, I will be using Python and C++ to compare three concepts: Parameter Passing, Garbage Collection, and Recursion

For Parameter passing C++ Does have the concept of Pass-by value and Pass-by Reference but in Python, the concept isn't there it is more so Call-by Object Reference where it passes a reference to an Object with one or more values. In the code, the C++ file shows that Pass-by Value copies the value and there are no formal changes to the caller while in  Pass-by Reference where changes made to formal are sent back to the caller via Parameter Passing and in Python all parameter passing is Passing by Object ref where it again passes a reference on an object of a value or values.

For Garbage Collection in C++, we have to keep track of what we do while in Python the developers have implemented a Garbage Collection Method. So in the code, I demonstrated how it would be handled in C++ usually with a more complex implementation but we use pointers and also new and delete. In Python, there are reference counters implemented for automatic garbage collection.


Recursion is where a function calls on itself in a loop. Both have similar implementations.


Overall, Python is easier to work with and can create complex solutions with relative ease. However, the Garbage Collection methods aren't always reliable. C++, harder to work with their paradigms creates a faster runtime because memory is managed manually.
