For the Final Project I will be using Python and C++ to compare three concepts: Parameter Passing, Garbage Collection and Recursion

For Parameter passing C++ Does have the concept of Pass-by value and Pass by Reference but in Python the concept isn't there it is more so Call-by Object Reference where it passes a reference to an Object one or more values. In the code, the C++ file where it shows Pass-by Value where it basically copied the valued and there are no formal changes to the caller while in  Pass-by Reference where changes made to formal are sent back the caller via Parameter Passing and in Python all parameter passing is Passing by Object ref where it again passes a reference on a object of a value or values.

For Garbage Collection where in C++ we have to keep track of what we do while in Python the developers have implemented a Garbage Collection Method. So in the code, I demonstrated how it would be handled in C++ usually with a more complex implement but we use pointers and also new and delete. In Python, there are reference counters implemented for automatic garbage collection.


Recursion, is where a function calls on itself in a loop. Both have Similar implementions.
