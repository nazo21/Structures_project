FInal Project for Structure of Programming

For the Final Project I will be using Python and C++ to compare three concepts: Parameter Passing, Garbage Collection and Recursion

For Parameter passing C++ Does have the concept of Pass-by value and Pass by Reference but in Python the concept isn't there it is more so Call-by Obj Reference, 

For Garbage Collection where in C++ we have to keep track of what we do while in Python the developers have implemented a Garbage Collection Method. So in the code, I demonstrated how it would be handled in C++ usually with a more complex implement but we use pointers and also new and delete. In Python, there are reference counters implemented for automatic garbage collection.


Recursion, is where a function calls on itself in a loop. Both have Similar implementions.
